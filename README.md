## 🚩 **Challenge 4: Minimum Viable Exchange**

This challenge will help you build/understand a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH). This repo is an updated version of the [original tutorial](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8F-minimum-viable-exchange-d84f30bd0c90) and challenge repos before it.
